# Text_Summarizer
Custom Text Summarizer using Transformer

Build a text summarization model leveraging transformer architectures (e.g., BERT, GPT). 
Train it on large datasets (e.g., Common Crawl or OpenWebText). Deploy the model using AWS (EC2 + S3) with a simple API or web app interface.
Stretch Goals: Optimize for distributed training on multiple GPUs using PyTorch Lightning or Hugging Face.
